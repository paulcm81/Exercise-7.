 Oh hello, I almost didn't see you there. How are you?
 Oh, you know, same as I ever was. What are you up to?
 Just out to pick up a few things before the stores close for the day. On that note, I should run.
 I'm well, thanks for asking. 
 How about you? Nice to see you. Let's catch-up soon.
 Ah, I won't keep you then.
